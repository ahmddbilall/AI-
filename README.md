## 🧬 About the Problem

Welcome to the Mitotic Cell Detection Challenge! 🧫🔬 In this competition, we invite data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and computer vision experts to develop innovative solutions for a critical task in cellular biology and medical research - distinguishing mitotic cells from normal cells in biological images.

Participants are provided with a dataset of labeled microscopic images, categorized into two classes: "Mitotic" and "Normal" cells. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately classify these images. This binary image classification task requires participants to process and analyze image data, extract relevant features, and apply appropriate techniques to distinguish between the two cell states.

🔍 **Key Objectives:**
- Develop a model to accurately classify microscopic images into "Mitotic" and "Normal" classes.
- Implement innovative approaches in image processing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.
- Contribute to advancements in cellular biology and medical research through machine learning and computer vision.

Let's dive into the challenge and explore the fascinating world of mitotic cell detection! 🌟
